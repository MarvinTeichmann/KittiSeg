# KittiSeg

KittiSeg performs segmentation of roads by utilizing an FCN based model. The model achieved [first place](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road_detail.php?result=ca96b8137feb7a636f3d774c408b1243d8a6e0df) on the Kitti Road Detection Benchmark at submission time and is descripted in our paper: [MultiNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07695).

The model is designed to perform well on small datasets. The training is done using just *250* densly labeled images. Despite this a state-of-the art MaxF1 score of over *96%* is archieved. The model is useable for real-time applications. Inference can be performed at the impressive speed of *95ms* per image.

The code contains for `train`, `evaluate` and `visualize` semantic segmentation in tensorflow. It is build to be compatible with the [TensorVision](http://tensorvision.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/tutorial.html#workflow) backend which allows to organize experiments in a very clean way.

## Requirements

The code requires Tensorflow 1.0 as well as the following python libraries: 

* matplotlib
* numpy
* Pillow
* scipy

Those modules can be installed using: `pip install numpy scipy pillow matplotlib` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:MarvinTeichmann/KittiSeg.git`
2. Initialize all submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Retrieve kitti data url here: [http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip)
4. Call `python download_data.py --kitti_url URL_YOU_RETRIEVED`

I strongly recommand using the `download_data.py` script to download the data. The script will also extract and prepare the data directory. See also Section [Managing Folders](README.md#managing-folders) to control where the data is stored.


## Tutorial

### Getting started

Run: `python evaluate.py` to evaluate a trained model. 

Run: `python train.py` to train a new model on the Kitti Data.

### Modifying Model & Train on your own data

The model is controlled by the file `hypes/KittiSeg.json`. Modifying this file should be enough to train the model on your own data and adjust the architecture according to your needs. You can create a new file `hypes/my_hype.json` and train that architecture using:

`python train.py --hypes hypes/my_hype.json`



For advanced modifications, the code is controlled by 5 different modules, which are specified in `hypes/KittiSeg.json`.

```
"model": {
   "input_file": "../inputs/kitti_seg_input.py",
   "architecture_file" : "../encoder/fcn8_vgg.py",
   "objective_file" : "../decoder/kitti_multiloss.py",
   "optimizer_file" : "../optimizer/generic_optimizer.py",
   "evaluator_file" : "../evals/kitti_eval.py"
},
```

Those modules operate independently. This allows easy experiments with different datasets (`input_file`), encoder networks (`architecture_file`), etc. Also see [TensorVision](http://tensorvision.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/tutorial.html#workflow) for a specification of each of those files.


## Managing Folders

By default, the data is stored in the folder `KittiSeg/DATA` and the output of runs in `KittiSeg/RUNS`. This behaviour can be changed by adjusting the environoment Variabels: `$TV_DIR_DATA` and `$TV_DIR_RUNS`. 

For organizing your experiments you can use:
`python train.py --project batch_size_bench --name size_5`. This will store the run in the subfolder:  `$TV_DIR_RUNS/batch_size_bench/size_5_%DATE`

This is useful if you want to run different series of experiments.


## Utilize TensorVision backend

KittiSeg is build on top of the TensorVision [TensorVision](https://github.com/TensorVision/TensorVision) backend. TensorVision modulizes computer vision training and helps organizing experiments. 


To utilize the entire TensorVision functionality install it using 

`$ cd KittiSeg/submodules/TensorVision` <br>
`$ python setup install`

Now you can use the TensorVision command line tools, which includes:

`tv-train --hypes hypes/KittiSeg.json` trains a json model. <br>
`tv-continue --logdir PATH/TO/RUNDIR` continues interrupted training <br>
`tv-analyze --logdir PATH/TO/RUNDIR` evaluated trained model <br>


## Useful Flags & Variabels

Here are some Flags which will be useful when working with KittiSeg and TensorVision. All flags are avaible across all scripts. 

`--hypes` : specify which hype-file to use <br>
`--logdir` : specify which logdir to use <br>
`--gpus` : specify on which GPUs to run the code <br>
`--name` : assign a name to the run <br>
`--project` : assign a project to the run <br>
`--nosave` : debug run, logdir will be set to `debug` <br>

In addition the following TensorVision environoment Variables will be useful:

`$TV_DIR_DATA`: specify meta directory for data <br>
`$TV_DIR_RUNS`: specify meta directiry for output <br>
`$TV_USE_GPUS`: specify default GPU behavour. <br>

On a cluster it is useful to set `$TV_USE_GPUS=force`. This will make the flag `--gpus` manditory and ensure, that run will be executed on the right gpu.
